# Session 1
### Content
1. Number of operations calculation
1. Factors in a number: any number that divide a given number is a factor of that number
1. Prime numbers - numbers that have only 2 factors (1 and the number itself)
1. $log_{a}b = x => a^x = b$ (To what power we need to raise a to get b?)
> Log formula:
> 1. $log_{a}a^n = n$

### Problems
1. Count factors of a number
1. Is a number prime?
1. Reverse an array
2. Rotate an array K number of times to right
